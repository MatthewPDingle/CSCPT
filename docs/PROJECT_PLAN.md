   - Each task from this project plan will be converted to a GitHub issue
   - Coding agents will be assigned specific issues

2. **Branch Management**:
   - Create feature branches using format: `feature/[issue-number]-[brief-description]`
   - Example: `feature/42-implement-hand-evaluator`

3. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Write unit tests for all new code
   - Ensure existing tests pass before submitting PR
   - Document test coverage

4. **Pull Request Format**:
   - Title: `[Issue #] Brief description of changes`
   - Description: Include detailed explanation of implementation approach
   - Reference the issue number using GitHub's linking syntax: `Closes #[issue-number]`
   - Include any notes on testing or special considerations

5. **Code Review Process**:
   - PRs will be reviewed by other agents or human reviewers
   - Address all review comments before merging
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes

## Next Immediate Steps for Play Testing

To enable play testing against AI opponents, focus on these critical tasks:

1. **Backend: AI Turn Triggering**
   - Modify the game service to recognize when it's an AI player's turn
   - Call the AI connector to get decisions for AI players
   - Process AI actions to advance the game state
   - Implement a full game loop that handles both human and AI players

2. **Frontend: Connect Real-time State**
   - Update GamePage.tsx to use WebSocket data instead of mock state
   - Connect action controls to send player decisions to backend
   - Add responsive feedback for game state changes

3. **Lobby to Game Flow**
   - Implement the start game functionality from lobby settings
   - Connect lobby player setup to backend player creation
   - Create proper navigation from lobby to game with correct game ID

These tasks come from the "Phase 3: Integration & Playability" section above and represent the minimum needed to achieve a playable game against AI opponents.
