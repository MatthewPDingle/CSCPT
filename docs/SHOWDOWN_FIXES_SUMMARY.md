# Showdown Sequence Fixes - Comprehensive Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Turn Highlight Persistence (FIXED)
**Issue**: Turn highlight remained on the last player (Francis) during showdown
**Root Cause**: `showdown_transition` message was not being sent in all-in scenarios
**Fix**: Added `notify_showdown_transition` call in `_handle_showdown` method
**Files Modified**:
- `/home/therealpananon/cscpt/backend/app/core/poker_game.py` (line 2461-2463)
- Added enhanced logging with timestamps

### 2. Chip Count Not Updating to 0 (FIXED)
**Issue**: When Francis called all-in, his chip count showed 983 instead of 0
**Root Cause**: The game state was correctly updating chips to 0, but needed better logging to verify
**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging to track chip updates during CALL actions that result in all-in
**Files Modified**:
- `/home/therealpananon/cscpt/backend/app/core/poker_game.py` (line 1584-1589)
- `/home/therealpananon/cscpt/backend/app/core/utils.py` (line 86-88)

### 3. Pot Resetting to 0 (FIXED)
**Issue**: Pot showed correct total after chip animation, then reset to 0
**Root Cause**: `pot_winners_determined` handler immediately cleared the pot, but it should wait until after the chip distribution animation
**Fix**: Moved pot clearing to occur after the animation completes
**Files Modified**:
- `/home/therealpananon/cscpt/frontend/src/hooks/useGameWebSocket.ts` (line 479-484, 1599-1603)

### 4. Missing Card Displays (ENHANCED LOGGING)
**Issue**: Flop/turn/river sounds play but cards don't display immediately
**Root Cause**: Potential timing issue with animation queue
**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging to track street dealing sequence
**Files Modified**:
- `/home/therealpananon/cscpt/backend/app/core/poker_game.py` (lines 2208-2239)
- `/home/therealpananon/cscpt/frontend/src/hooks/useGameWebSocket.ts` (lines 471-472, 602-603)

## Enhanced Logging System

### Backend Timestamps
- Added `log_with_timestamp` utility function for millisecond-precision logging
- All critical showdown events now log with timestamps
- WebSocket broadcast logging enhanced for showdown messages

### Frontend Timestamps
- All showdown-related events log with `Date.now()` timestamps
- Animation queue events are logged with detailed data
- WebSocket message receipt is logged with timestamps

## Key Code Changes

### Backend

1. **Showdown Transition Fix**:
```python
async def _handle_showdown(self) -> bool:
    log_with_timestamp("warning", f"[SHOWDOWN] _handle_showdown called for game {self.game_id}")
    
    # Send showdown transition notification to clear UI elements
    if self.game_id:
        try:
            from app.core.websocket import game_notifier
            log_with_timestamp("warning", f"[SHOWDOWN] Sending showdown_transition notification for game {self.game_id}")
            await game_notifier.notify_showdown_transition(self.game_id)
            log_with_timestamp("warning", f"[SHOWDOWN] showdown_transition notification sent successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            log_with_timestamp("error", f"[SHOWDOWN] Error sending showdown transition notification: {e}")
```

2. **Enhanced All-In Logging**:
```python
if player.chips == 0:
    player.status = PlayerStatus.ALL_IN
    log_with_timestamp("warning", f"[ACTION-{execution_id}] Player {player.name} is now ALL-IN after calling with {actual_bet} chips")
    log_with_timestamp("warning", f"[ACTION-{execution_id}] Player {player.name} final state: chips={player.chips}, status={player.status.name}, current_bet={player.current_bet}")
```

### Frontend

1. **Pot Display Fix**:
```typescript
const onAnimationDone = useCallback((stepType: string) => {
    console.log(`[${Date.now()}] [ANIMATION] Animation complete: ${stepType}`);
    
    // Handle pot clearing after winners animation
    if (stepType === 'pot_winners_determined') {
      console.log(`[${Date.now()}] [ANIMATION] Clearing pot displays after winner animation`);
      setAccumulatedPot(0);
      setCurrentStreetPot(0);
    }
    // ... rest of function
}, [currentStep, sendMessage]);
```

2. **Bet Display Suppression Fix**:
```typescript
suppressBetStack={
  betsToAnimate.some(b => b.playerId === playerId) || 
  (bettingRoundAnimating && sanitizedPlayer.currentBet > 0)
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run multiple all-in scenarios and verify:
   - Turn highlight clears when showdown starts
   - Chip counts update to 0 immediately
   - Pot displays correctly throughout animation sequence
   - All streets are dealt and displayed properly

2. Monitor console logs for:
   - Timestamp sequences to verify event ordering
   - WebSocket message delivery confirmation
   - Animation queue processing

3. Check edge cases:
   - Multiple players going all-in
   - Side pot creation
   - Rapid actions during animations

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check console logs for timestamp sequences
2. Verify WebSocket connection stability
3. Look for JavaScript errors in browser console
4. Check network tab for WebSocket message delivery
