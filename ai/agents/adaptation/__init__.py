"""
Advanced adaptation components for poker agents.

This module provides components for enhancing poker agents with:
1. Dynamic adjustment to changing game conditions
2. Tournament stage awareness
3. Exploit-aware behaviors

These components build on the memory system to provide more sophisticated
adaptation capabilities while maintaining the archetype identity of agents.
