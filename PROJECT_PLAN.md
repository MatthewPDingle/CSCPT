## Current Focus
We are currently focused on Phase 2, implementing the AI integration components. The LLM provider abstraction layer has been completed with support for Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT models, and Google Gemini models. This abstraction allows for seamless switching between different AI providers while maintaining a consistent interface for basic completion, JSON-structured outputs, and extended thinking features.

Next steps include developing the poker-specific AI agents that will leverage the LLM providers for hand analysis, coaching, and player simulation.

## Key Challenges and Mitigation Strategies
1. **AI Model Limitations**: Implement fallback mechanisms between providers when rate limits are hit or a provider is unavailable.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize API calls to minimize latency and costs.
3. **Real-time Gameplay Stability**: Implement robust WebSocket handling with reconnection and state recovery.
4. **Complex Poker Logic**: Thorough testing of game engine with comprehensive test suite covering edge cases.
5. **User Experience**: Regular user testing and feedback collection throughout development.
